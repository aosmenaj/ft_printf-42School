> A reimplementation of the `printf` function in C – part of the 42 School curriculum.

## 📚 Project Description

**ft_printf** is a core project at 42 School that consists of recreating the standard `printf` function, one of the most powerful and flexible functions in the C standard library.

The goal is to deeply understand string formatting, parsing, and variadic argument handling using `stdarg.h`.

## 🔧 Function Prototype

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
